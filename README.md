# CSS-and-Web-Practice

Hey reader! Welcome to NlSEMONO's CSS and Web Practice repository! 

As of 9/22/22, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate my HTML/CSS skills, with a focus on flexboxes. This project is a **WIP.** 

Depending on how satisfied I am with the final version of this project, I may continue to work on it when I inevitably create a webpage to demonstrate my skills in NodeJS and ExpressJS. Alternatively, I may elect to create a whole new project with new HTML and CSS when creating a project with the aforementioned JS libraries.
